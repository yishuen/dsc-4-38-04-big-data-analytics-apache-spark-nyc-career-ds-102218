    "Big Data Analytics is an emerging area of interest both for business and academia. There are a lot of details around the characteristics of big data and How Apache spark eases up the job of analyzing huge amounts of data using a simple programming paradigm. In this section we shall look at understanding and implementing a simple problem using MapReduce in Pyspark. Real world problems, however, are much more complicated than this and you should be able to scale up the takeaways from our simple word count example to much bigger problems. This lesson aims to provide you with a wider understanding on MapReduce and big data computation in Apache Spark Environment. \n"
